import (
	"context"
)

// Runtime defines the host integration surface for field resolution, batching,
// abstract type resolution, and leaf-value serialization used by the Executor.
//
// General contract
//   - The Executor performs a breadth-first execution. At each depth it drains all
//     synchronous fields first via ResolveSync, then calls BatchResolveAsync ONCE
//     with all async tasks collected at that depth. The next depth does not begin
//     until BatchResolveAsync returns and those results are completed.
//   - The Executor guarantees that ResolveSync is never invoked for fields marked
//     async, and BatchResolveAsync is only invoked when there is at least one
//     async field at the current depth.
//   - Errors returned from any method are converted into located GraphQL errors.
//     If the fieldâ€™s return type is Non-Null, the Executor will propagate the
//     null up to the nearest nullable ancestor per GraphQL spec.
//   - Implementations should be stateless or otherwise concurrency-safe. The
//     Executor may call these methods concurrently for different operations.
//   - Implementations must not mutate source or args values.
//
// Object/field identifiers
// - objectType is the GraphQL type name (e.g. "User").
// - field is the GraphQL field name on that type (e.g. "posts").
// - For root fields, objectType is the root type name (e.g. "Query").
// - source is the parent object value (nil for root).
// - args is the map of argument names to already-coerced Go values.
//
// Abstract types and leaf values
//   - ResolveType must return the concrete type name for interface/union values.
//   - SerializeLeafValue must coerce/serialize scalars and enums into JSON-safe
//     Go values (string, float64, int32/int64, bool, []byte as base64 string, etc.).
//     For enums, return the enum name as string.
//
// Partial success and determinism
//   - BatchResolveAsync must return one AsyncResolveResult per task. Each result
//     is independent; failures in one do not affect others. The Executor supports
//     partial success.
//   - Results MUST be returned in the same order as the input tasks. The result at
//     index i corresponds to the task at index i (results[i] corresponds to tasks[i]).
//
// Cancellation
//   - The Executor filters out tasks whose response paths were nullified by a
//     Non-Null violation, so BatchResolveAsync receives only live tasks. The
//     runtime implementation does not need to handle cancellation tokens beyond
//     respecting ctx.
//
// Performance guidance
//   - Implementations should batch by (objectType, field) and backend affinity.
//   - For highly parallel backends, you can fan out internally but still return a
//     single []AsyncResolveResult to the Executor.
//
// Idempotency
//   - Calls should be idempotent where practical; the Executor will not retry on
//     its own, but client-side retries may occur at higher layers.
//
// Transport coupling
//   - The Runtime interface is transport-agnostic. A gRPC-backed runtime should
//     translate these contracts into the appropriate protobuf RPCs and messages.
